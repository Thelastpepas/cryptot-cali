# Message Encryption and Decryption
____________________________  
This project is a desktop application that allows encrypting and decrypting messages using symmetric cryptographic algorithms. It is developed in Python using the Kivy framework for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Description
____________________________  
The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a cryptographic key. The available algorithms for encryption are: Twofish, Serpent, AES (Rijndael), Camellia, Salsa20, ChaCha20, Blowfish, CAST5, Kuznyechik, RC4, DES, 3DES, Skipjack, Safer, and IDEA.

## Requirements
____________________________  
- Python 3.9.13  
- Kivy 2.3.0  

  ```bash
  pip install pycryptodome
  ```

- Install Kivy:

  ```bash
  pip install kivy
  ```

- Install `cryptography`:

  ```bash
  pip install cryptography
  ```

- Run the encryption module:

  ```bash
  python aes_encryption.py
  ```

## Installation
____________________________  
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.  
2. Make sure you have Python 3.9.13 installed on your system.  



##  Execution
0. Install flash:

 ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
 
____________________________  
1. Install `pycryptodome`:

   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```

2. Run the main module using url:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Steps to run the code by urls
- For the console we use
```bash
python app.py
```
- To run all tests in the test folder, use this command
  ```bash
  python test/test_app.py

   ```


## database
# install the following libraries:
- psycopg2
- sys
- os
- ryptography
- base64

## place your database data in the secretconfig folder:
PGHOST='******
PGDATABASE=*****
PGUSER=****
PGPASSWORD=****

## execution

once you have done the above, run the app.py module
either from the cmd or visual code
if it is from the cmd, it is recommended to put it on the desktop and access the folder with the cd command
